# Factorial Calculator in C++

This is a simple program in C++ that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer. It supports results up to 64-bit output.

## Functionality

The program prompts the user to enter an integer to calculate its factorial. Then, it checks if the entered number is non-negative. If it is, the program calculates the factorial of the number and displays the result. Otherwise, it displays a message indicating that the entered value is invalid.

## Limitation

- There is no handling for inputs that are not integers.

## How to Use

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the program.
3. Enter a non-negative integer when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display the factorial of the entered number.
